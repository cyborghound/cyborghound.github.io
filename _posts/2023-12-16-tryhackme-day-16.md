McGreedy has locked McSkidy out of his Elf(TM) HQ admin panel by changing the password! To make it harder for McSkidy to perform a hack-back, McGreedy has altered the admin panel login so that it uses a CAPTCHA to prevent automated attacks. A CAPTCHA is a small test, like providing the numbers in an image, that needs to be performed to ensure that you are a human. This means McSkidy canâ€™t perform a brute force attack. Or does it?

After the great success of using machine learning to detect defective toys and phishing emails, McSkidy is looking to you to help him build a custom brute force script that will make use of ML to solve the CAPTCHA and continue with the brute force attack. There is, however, a bit of irony in having a machine solve a challenge specifically designed to tell humans apart from computers.
