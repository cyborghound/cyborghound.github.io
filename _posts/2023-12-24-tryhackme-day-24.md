Detective Frost-eau continues to piece the evidence together, and Tracy McGreedy is now a suspect. What’s more, the detective believes that McGreedy communicated with an accomplice.

Smartphones are now an indispensable part of our lives for most of us. We use them to communicate with friends, family members, and colleagues, browse the Internet, shop online, perform e-banking transactions, and many other things. Among other reasons, it’s because smartphones are so intertwined in our activities that they can help exonerate or convict someone of a crime.

Frost-eau suggests that Tracy’s company-owned phone be seized so that Forensic McBlue can analyse it in his lab to collect digital evidence. Because it’s company-owned, no complicated legal procedures are required.
