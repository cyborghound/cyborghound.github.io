With the chaos of the recent merger, the company's security landscape has turned into the Wild West. Servers and endpoints, once considered fortresses, now resemble neglected outposts on the frontier, vulnerable to any attacker.

As McHoneyBell sifts through the reports, a sense of urgency gnaws at her. "This is a ticking time bomb," she mutters to herself. It's clear they need a strategy, and fast.

Determined, McHoneyBell rises from her chair, her mind racing with possibilities. "Time to suit up, team. We're going deep!" she declares, her tone a blend of resolve and excitement. "Defence in Depth isn't just a strategy; it's our lifeline. We're going to fortify every layer, from the physical servers in the basement to the cloud floating above us. Every byte, every bit."

In this task, we will be hopping into McHoneyBell's shoes and exploring how the defence in depth strategy can help strengthen the environment's overall security posture.
