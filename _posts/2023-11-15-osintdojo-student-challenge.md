For the OSINTDojo student rank I need to make a write up from an OSINT quiz I found on the internet.
Because I need to do two quizes, I made this write up for both.
The first quiz I used the following tweet from Julia Bayer.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It’s <a href="https://twitter.com/quiztime?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@quiztime</a> and it’s <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MondayQuiz?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MondayQuiz</a>.<br><br>Can you find this exact window?<br><br>📐 Bonus: How many meters is it from the ground?<br><br>📮reply just to me with an answer<br>🤝 reply to all for collaboration<br>🌈have fun <a href="https://t.co/iNJbVCF8cH">pic.twitter.com/iNJbVCF8cH</a></p>&mdash; Julia Bayer (@bayer_julia) <a href="https://twitter.com/bayer_julia/status/1719089711409508837?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 30, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

# Steps
>- First I used Google Lens and uploaded the picture to see if Google would find any matches which look like churches in this picture.
>- I also noticed an interesting building with a funny roof in the background.
>- Google came back with pictures which in the first row were pictures of a Cathedral in Cologne.
>- This Cathedral in Cologne looked the same as the one in the picture.
>- Then I went looking on Google Maps, especially with street view and found the building with the funny roof was actually the Ludwig Museum.
>- So I knew this was the right Cathedral.
>- Then I used Google to find out were you could actually walk to in meters.
>- I Googled for "cologne cathedral walking meters" and found this site: https://www.cologne-tourism.com/arts-culture/sights/cologne-cathedral/tower-climb		
>- I could see that you could actually walk to 97 meters.
>- Then I found this picture on Google Maps: https://maps.app.goo.gl/BDJby8dHmujWF6db8 	
>- On the right side you can actually see the two windows in the picture from the side.
>- If you create an imaginary line from the the main tower to the windows from the quiz picture, it looks like it goes to the second floor of the main tower.
>- The Cathedral itself is 157 meters (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cologne_Cathedral) on the highest point and it looks like the floors are all the same height.
>- In the picture from Google Maps it looks like the main tower is 4 parts with windows and the last part of the tower roof, which looks like the same height as the other parts.
>- You could say the photographer was at a height between 80 and 97 meters if you count the parts, and guessing that you have to walk to the latest floor to get a view, he/she would be at 97 meters, because a lower floor would not provide you with this shot.
>- Then you would be to low.

For the second quiz I used a tweet from Julia Bayer again.

# Steps
>- For this quiz I also used Google Lens the picture.
>-  In the first row of results I found a picture of a building which looked much like the building I was looking for.
>-  I found this url: https://www.transartists.org/en/air/savvy-contemporary-residency
>-  On the bottom of the page I found an adress, which I could check in Google Maps.
>-  Richardstraße 43/44, but in street view I did not find my building.
>-  Then again I used Google Lens, but this time on a smaller part without the top.
>-  This time I got the same building in the first row agaian, but a different website.
>-  The url was: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:09090448_Richardstra%C3%9Fe_20.jpg		
>-  The adres in the title of the image is Richardstraße 20, which I looked for on Google Maps.
>-	When going into street view, I directly found the place were the picture was taken from.
>-	Richardstraße 20
